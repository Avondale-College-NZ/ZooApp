HOW TO RUN?
------------
If you have downloaded the zip file make sure you have extracted the file and then opening up the .sln file this will open up visual studio and save it on your computer. After you may view all my fiels such as my controller,views,models and etc. 
But inorder to run my project and initialize the database, you ened to run this command : Update-Database (inorder for the project to run and function). Enter this commadn in the NUGET-PACKMANAGER CONSOLE.
If that doesnt work go to TOOLS>NUGET PACKAGE MANAGER > MANAGE NUGET PACKAGES FOR SOLUTION and then there search up and install these addons:
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design


Alternatively you can copy and paste the repository link into visual studio to clone the repository then you culd just run the command and it should work unless you havent gotten the addons above.
Remember you need to create an account inorder to buy tickets and post comments. 

Enjoy :)
